                <p> Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. Six weeks later the
                    family moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they
                    moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the
                    Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In
                    1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a
                    teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he
                    obtained his doctor’s degree. </p>
